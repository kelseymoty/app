- having them reference previously defined item in list would be complex, as then I'd have to scan all ids
  - whereas making it a practice to move them outside into a variable and then re-use, is better
    - but would conflict with referencing ids if I let them do that?
      - unless they use a specific format that only has the id, in which case it would be referencing that scanned id.. or a variable name
        - but it just seems like it is better to let them copy and paste, and encourage them to move them into variables as needed
          - simpler, achieves the objective and encourages keeping things flat
            - use the facilities we have already
              -  they technically could use the yaml extension to dupe stuff
              - or I could make something potentially error prone to enable them to do the same.. but the point being it's just complex

              - re-evaluate when we get there

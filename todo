- get finishedEvent wired between parents and children
- get the incrementer function working. later break into its own service






- figure out modifiedProperties or propertiesDiff or whatever it is that gets passed back
- make function to deal with it - actual diff function? replace that _single_ or any objects sent back
  - so it's very simple and consistent behavior - any items marked to be replaced, are the ones that are replaced
    - is this implicit, or explicit? if a type only has a single return type, then it should be clear what it is
    - as there should only be one parameter that has the response values

    - should those become a type that is defined right there in params? or is this again already clear
    - FOR NOW, just replace that single object of each type that will later be marked as the response type
    - or the values-carrying type. each stimuli has one of these? it's meeting an interface or just a role
    - at the end of it, could just have a marker of 'responder' 

- break out coordinate into its own type. first in the same file, then move it elsewhere

- get the utils functions fixed and in a service
- finish shuffling things so there are no cyclic dependencies




- figure out communication/store between siblings, deprecate children?
